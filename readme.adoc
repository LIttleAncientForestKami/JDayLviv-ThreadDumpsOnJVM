= Thread-dumps on JVM @ JDay Lviv

== Promise
How can you take a threaddump? 
Print threads? 
What is a safepoint and why you should care? 
Which tools can help and how? 
And when you have the threaddump... what's in there? 
We'll talk threads and locks. Dead and alive alike. 
We'll talk CLI and GUI (tools, of course). 
We'll talk about thread lifecycle. 
And naming. Oh, the naming! 
Example rich talk, though rather aimed at beginners. 

== JVM overview

From http://2.bp.blogspot.com/:

image::JVM_middleware_interactions.png[Image showing where threads work and from where they originate from]

=== Threads

. instances of java.lang.Thread
. have associated native thread
. have names (or are named Thread#nextNumberInSequence)
. have local variables, accessible only to given thread

[IMPORTANT]
.Thread lifecycle
====
*Enum: `java.lang.Thread.State`:*

NEW:: Thread state for a thread which has not yet started.

RUNNABLE:: Thread state for a runnable thread.

BLOCKED:: Thread state for a thread blocked waiting for a monitor lock.

WAITING:: A thread in the waiting state is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action.

TIMED_WAITING:: A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in this state. 

TERMINATED:: A thread that has exited is in this state. 

`Thread.getState()` gives you that.
====
Native thread gets created in NEW and reclaimed upon thread termination.

CAUTION: _RUNNABLE_ means OK, right?



=== Thread limits?

Are there any?

What limits the threads?

image::Heap.png[JVM and RAM]

Let's add more for just one JVM:

image::MemoryInJVM.png[Memory organization in JVM]

See `limit`, Bash built-in. In my case:
----
➜  ThreaddumpsOnJVM git:(master) ✗ limit
cputime         unlimited
filesize        unlimited
datasize        unlimited
stacksize       8MB
coredumpsize    0kB
memoryuse       unlimited
maxproc         63635
descriptors     1024
memorylocked    64kB
addressspace    unlimited
maxfilelocks    unlimited
sigpending      63635
msgqueue        819200
nice            0
rt_priority     0
rt_time         unlimited
----
Interesting limits are _stacksize_, _descriptors_ and _maxfilelocks_ when speaking about threads.

== How can you take a threaddump?

. `kill -3 JAVA_PID_HERE`


=== About kill command

kill:: send a signal to a process

 kill -9 111
 kill -s SIGKILL 111 
 kill -KILL 111


May be a shell built-in AND a command: `which kill`
Essentially a wrapper around _kill_ syscall.

. `kill -L` - no such option on my Ubuntu/Bash
.. `kill -l`
. `/bin/kill -L`
.. `/bin/kill -l` - same as built-in

[TIP]
.Further reading about `kill`
====
Excellent pieces of information, especially the first one:


. http://www.linux.org/threads/kill-signals-and-commands-revised.8096/
. http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_12_01.html
====

=== About signals

`/bin/kill -L`

Default? *TERM*

`man --section 7 signals | grep SIGQUIT`
`man --section 7 signals | grep Core`

[CAUTION]
.Java and signals
==== 
`-Xrs`:: disables default signals for Java applications
====

=== PID of a Java process?
. ps aux | grep java
. pgrep java
. jps -l
jps::
Lists the instrumented Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) on the target
system. This command is experimental and unsupported.
. jcmd
jcmd::
sends diagnostic command requests to a running JVM.

image::javapid.gif[Image shows comparison of ways above]

image::java_pid_java_tools.png[Image shows how Java tools offer Java PIDs]


[WARNING]
.`jps` output is empty?
====
. which user is running the Java process you are looking for?
. `ls -l /tmp/hsperfdata_YourUserHere/`
. check the `-Djava.io.tmpdir` flag or start JVM setting it to `=/someDir`.

====


== How can you take a threaddump?

. `kill -3 JAVA_PID`
. `jstack JAVA_PID`

jstack:: 
Prints Java thread stack traces for a Java process, core file,
or remote debug server. This command is experimental and unsupported.

TIP: Poor man's debugger? `jstack` in a loop... However, can pinpoint live-locks!


== How can you take a threaddump?

. `kill -3 JAVA_PID`
. `jstack JAVA_PID`
. `Ctrl`+`\`
. `jconsole`
. `jvisualvm`

[CAUTION]
.Dump location? 
====
. Your process' console
. Current directory
. JVM settings
.. different JVMs, different flags
. System settings?
.. `man core`
.. `cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2062493/jvm-thread-dump-location

====

== Printing threads then?

`jcmd`


=== Going native...

`whichThreadIsIt.sh`

`ps -mo lwp,c -p 14222`

=== Safepoints

What is a safepoint and why you should care? 

=== Thread dump then

And when you have the threaddump... what's in there? 

. JVM and Java info
. Thread dump info
. Stack traces of threads
. Heap breakdown

=== Comparing printing threads
With `-l` we have also lock information, who holds what:

image::comparisonBetweenThreadsAndThreadsWithLocks.png[Shows difference between just printing threads and printing them with lock info via `-l`]
